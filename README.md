# freshworks_assignment
Submission for the Off-Campus Recruitment assignment. 

1.The NodeJS program file "Merge.js" is available in the root directory "freshworks_assignment".

2.The input files data1.json,data2.json,data3.json and the output files merge1.json,merge2.json will be stored in "strikers" folder.

3.The "strikers" folder also contains a dummy file "data4.jsom" to demsontrate that the function considers only ".json" files.


Code: 
The fucntion merge which incorporates all the requirements in demand takes in 5 parameters. 
  a. Folder name
  b. Input File name
  c. Output File name
  d. Max size
  e. Key value (additional parameter, this allows the function to merge array with different key values like "employee")

Other documentation available in code itself. 

Outputs: 
 Output - 1: 
	It merges arrays with "strikers" as key value. 
 Output - 2:
	Demonstrates the max size limitation of the problem.
 Output - 3:
	Demonstrates the different key value merging. 

In every output the the  "data4.jsom" file is neglected successfully.
